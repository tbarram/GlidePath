The objects start out in random locations. The only force on them is 
gravity - each object applies gravity to each other object based on 
the well-known gravity equation:

   Force = (G * mass1 * mass2) / (distance ^ 2)


(It is sometimes better to turn off the trails so that you can focus on the 
effects of gravity.)

Because of the distance in the denominator, the effect of gravity gets 
bigger as the objects get close - and since distance is squared, it is 
non-linear which is why the objects speed up so much as they get close.

You can change the # of objects. You can also drag objects around in order 
to try different starting configurations. For example, try dragging 2 objects 
right next to each other, then watch to see if they can escape each other's 
orbit, or if they remain "stuck" together - since the distance between them 
is so small, their gravitational attraction is very big. 

The blue thing in the middle is the ship. It has the same mass as all the 
objects, but it is fixed in the center. This helps the objects stay centered.

You can fly the ship using the arrow keys to rotate, and up arrow (or 'Z')
to thrust. This works best with a small # of objects. 

If you add "?game=1" (no quotes) to the end of the URL, the game will start. 
You score points by 1) rotating and 2) staying close to the ground. You can 
shoot the falling object with 'X' but they arent worth any points (yet).
