The objects start out in random locations. The only force on them is 
gravity - each object applies gravity to each other object based on 
the well-known gravity equation:

   Force = (G * mass1 * mass2) / (distance ^ 2)


Because of the distance in the denominator, the effect of gravity gets 
bigger as the objects get close - and since distance is squared, it is 
non-linear which is why the objects speed up so much as they get close.

You can change the # of objects. You can also drag objects around in order 
to try different starting configurations. For example, try dragging 2 objects 
right next to each other, then watch to see if they can escape each other's 
orbit, or if they remain "stuck" together - since the distance between them 
is so small, their gravitational attraction is very big. For this it is 
sometimes better to turn off the trails so that you can focus on the effects 
of gravity.
